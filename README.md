# Heart_Disease_prediction_using_deep_learning

---
## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project presents a hybrid deep learning system for binary heart disease classification. It combines:

- A neural network trained on **clinical tabular data** from the UCI Cleveland dataset.
- A CNN trained on **ECG image data**.
- A **fusion mechanism** to combine both model predictions into a final decision.

The goal is to mirror real-world diagnostic reasoning by integrating both structured data and physiological signals.

- **Image Data:** ECG images categorized as:
  - Normal
  - Abnormal heartbeat
  - Myocardial infarction
  - History of MI
